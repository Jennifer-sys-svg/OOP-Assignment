# OOP Assignment - Superhero and Vehicle Classes

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.

## Files:

1. **superhero.py**: Contains the `Superhero` class and a subclass `FlyingHero`, demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism.
2. **vehicles.py**: Contains the `Vehicle` base class and subclasses `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`, each overriding the `move` method to show polymorphism in action.
